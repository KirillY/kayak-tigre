📍Tigre

Immerse yourself in a world of luxuriant wilderness where people live on water. There are no roads here, only an endless network of streams and channels. Before you lies the delta of South America's second-largest river - the Paraná.

#### Why Choose Our Tour?
From the city's central pier, we'll head to remote islands and quiet forest streams, away from the noise and busy navigation of Tigre's tourist center - especially important for kayaking beginners and participants with children. We'll meet you with a private boat, and the river cruise to our base is included in the tour price.

We also prepare a hearty breakfast with Russian pancakes, various snacks, fruits, and freshly brewed coffee on all our programs.

On weekends, we run two main programs: the long "Esperita" kayak tour (full day) and the short "Torito" tour (half day), where you can also choose SUP. We name them after the beautiful streams these routes follow.

On weekdays, you can book a private tour.

#### Esperita. A Hundred River Turns.
🕙 10:00 - 19:00

A complete immersion in nature, unique locations.
We'll kayak through four different rivers, land at an island festival square and cross the island through a jungle trail. At the end, we'll visit President Sarmiento's museum-dacha, enclosed in a huge glass cube.
🛶 Paddling through narrow forest streams 11 km, ~3 hours on water
🏃 Trekking across the island through jungle to President Sarmiento's museum-dacha, ~1 hour walk
